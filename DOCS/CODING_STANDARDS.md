- Validate HTML markup using tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service.

## CSS

- Indent CSS with 2 spaces.
- Use meaningful and lowercase class names (e.g., `btn-primary`, `card-header`).
- Prefer external CSS files over inline styles.
- Minimize the use of inline styles.

## JavaScript and jQuery

- Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- Avoid global variables whenever possible.
